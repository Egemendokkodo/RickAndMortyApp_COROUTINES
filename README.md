# RickAndMortyApp_COROUTINES
I created a Rick and Morty mobile app. With this app, you can access any information about the Rick and Morty TV series. I used coroutines effectively and added a lazy load feature.

Splash Screen Activity:

If the user enters the application for the first time, it shows the "Welcome" message, and on subsequent entries, it shows the message 'hello'.

MainActivity:

There are 2 RecyclerViews. The one at the top shows the locations, and the one at the bottom shows the residents at the location.

If you click a RecyclerView item from the top, the clicked item will be highlighted.
