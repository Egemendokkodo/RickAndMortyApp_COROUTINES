# RickAndMortyApp_COROUTINES
I created a rick and morty mobile app, with this app you can reach any info about Rick And Morty tv series. I used coroutines effectively and i added lazy load feature.


Splash Screen Activity : <br><br>
If the user enters the application for the first time, it shows the "Welcome" message, and on subsequent entries, it shows the message 'hello'. <br><br>

MainActivity: <br><br>
There are 2 recyclerviews, the one at the top shows the locations, the one at the bottom shows the residents at the location. <br><br>
If you click a recyclerview item from the top, clicked item will be highlighted. <br><br>
